Rules For variables:
##################################

1. Variable names are case-sensitive. Example: message and Message are two variable.
2. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores or dollar signs 
and must begin with a letter, an underscrore, or a dollar sign but con not contain any spaces.
Example: _yourName, $amiba, $yourName
3. Variable Names can not use the reserved keywords.

Note: Best practice to write a variable in camelcase system. example: myName.


#Difference between undefined and undeclered variable
########################################################

let message; 
console.log(message); // undefined

Note: Which variable is decleared but not initialized that is undefined. And which one
is not decleared that one is undecleared or not defined variable.
